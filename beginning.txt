You wake up to realize you are being attacked.  
You hear pounding at your door and you then realize that you have been ambushed and must fight to recover your castle. 
But you cannot defeat the enemy without your family's legendary weapon. 
You get out of bed.  
You must fight but you do not have a weapon. 
You must look throughout your room to find a sword to fight with.
